# Contributing to Documatic VSCode extension

Welcome,
and thank you for considering
contributing to the
Documatic VSCode extension.
All contributions,
no matter how "small" -
whether that's opening a PR for a new feature
or just :+1: on a bug report -
are helpful and welcome.

## Code of conduct

Every member contributing
to this repository
is expected
and required,
at all times
to be respectful,
curteous and civil,
to both the Documatic team
and other contributing members.
No contributor shall use swear words,
racist or sexist messaging
or terms which could otherwise deemed
to be offensive or demeaning
to a person or group of people.

We appreciate that it can be frustrating
when software does not work as expected,
however we do not tolerate any disrespectful
or offensive messaging
related to actual
or perceived issues
with the management
and development of the extension.

Any failure to comply with the guidelines outlined in this document
may result in you being banned from this and other Documatic forums,
and barred from accessing Documatic products.

## Reporting bugs

There are a number of things to include
in a bug report
to make it as clear as possible for the team,
and therefore more likely to be fixed:

* The actions you took to experience the bug
* The behaviour you expected to happen
* The behaviour you actually experienced
* System information
  * VSCode extension version
  * VSCode version
  * Operating system version

The Documatic team will triage your report
and inform you if/when a fix is being released.

## Feature request

Got an awesome idea for how to improve the extension?
Please open an issue detailing
what you'd like to see.
The Documatic team will factor the request into our roadmap
and update the issue when it's ready for release.

If there's an existing feature request you like the sound of,
please upvote (:+1:) the issue.
This helps the Documatic team know which features
to prioritise.

## Questions

about how to use the extension?
Please open an issue
and we'll get back to you.
